\f0\fs24 \cf0 Today, I continue to polish and add some description on every food that I input on my chosen app using the flutter. I add some drawer and on tap so that when the user click the image/s of the food that they are curious or want to taste base on their cravings. They will have some details on what\'92s the benefits of the food that they will order on their body. This is the app that will not just make their cravings satisfy but will also help them to have a healthy living. Since every food on this app is nutritious that will help them to take care of their health. Additionally, sir Rommel taught us regarding go lang and some codes that we need to answer that we can use to have a backend on our app. It is indeed helpful for us and much clearer to understand since sir Rommel is a great immediate supervisor.}
